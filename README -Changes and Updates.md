I am trying to explain here, about the changes that I have made to this application briefly.

1. Created new "Models" folder and added new class item.cs
2. Created new "Controller" folder and created new IBaseClass,BaseClass.
3. Created new "BusinessObjects" folder and created individual class files for each logic. (by following SOLID PRINCIPLES)
4. Created new "Input" folder and added a text file with input data.
5. Implement dependency injection.
6. Implement exception handling using try catch.
7. Implement logging using log4net
8. Created additional test cases in separate files for separate logic
